# go-rest-service


### What was done
1. Implementation of the repository package with methods (Add, Get, Delete) object
2. Implementation of the postgres DB connection.
3. Creation of init DB script
4. Creation of Dockerfile as well as the docker-compose file for local testing
5. Creation of go modules for the libraries that we are using.


### What was not done 
1. Polishing code, by calling all the components together on main.go
2. Not fully understanding of how the 2 handlers are working and in general how would be the final solution.

### In the final version, code could run by docker-compose up command
